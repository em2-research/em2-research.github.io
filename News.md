##### Mon, 08/05/2024
Chemical short-range order (CSRO) has been explored as a new design parameter for tuning the performance of multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs), yet its formation kinetics remains unclear. Here, our paper demonstrates that significant CSRO forms during solidification, making it ubiquitous in many MPEAs. Check our paper on _[**Nature Communications**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49606-1)_, as well as the [**Penn State News**](https://www.psu.edu/news/materials-research-institute/story/atoms-advanced-alloys-find-preferred-neighbors-when-solidifying/).

High and medium-entropy alloys have shown exceptional mechanical performance, yet the role of short-range order (SRO) on these properties has been unclear. In our recent publication, we demonstrate that the reduction of SRO by deformation leads to rejuvenation, explaining their remarkable damage tolerance. Check our paper on _[**Nature Communications**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-45696-z)_, as well as the [**Penn State News**](https://www.psu.edu/news/engineering/story/new-structural-insights-could-lead-mechanical-enhancement-alloys/).
